# Pure CSS Lightbox
## Or, how the :trigger selector is kinda awesome

Please take a look at the MDN documentation for the [:trigger pseudo-class selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:target) to see where this idea begins. I plan on adding animations and expanding on the design. But at its core, this is an exercise in leveraging CSS to replace presentational concerns previously controlled exclusively by Javascript.
